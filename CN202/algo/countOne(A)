Algorithm countOne(A)
   Input: Two-dimensional array A with size n x n in which each element is either 0 or 1
          and in each row all 1's precedes all 0's.
   Output: return the number of 1's in A

count = 0;
for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
{
  low = 0;
  high = n - 1;
  mid = 0;

  while (low <= high)
  {
    mid = (low + high)/2;
    if (A[i][mid] == 0)
       high = mid - 1;
    else
       low = mid + 1;
  }
  count = count + (high + 1);
}
return count;
