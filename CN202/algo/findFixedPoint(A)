Algorithm findFixedPoint(A)
  Input: an ordered array A of n integers whose values are distinct
         (that is for i != j, A[i] != A[j])
  Output: return true if there is an index i such that A[i] == i
          return false, otherwise

low = 0;
high = n-1;
while (low <= high)
{
  mid = (low+high)/2;
  if (a[mid] == mid)
    return true;
  else if (a[mid] > mid)
    high = mid-1; // consider lower half
  else
    low = mid+1;  // consider upper half
}
return false;
